# This is a simple script to sync a single DMX fixture with a hue bulb for the ENTTEC OPEN DMX USB dongle.
#
# When succesfully installed it will enable you to control the DMX fixture from the Philips Hue app.
#
# Note: ENTTEC OPEN DMX PRO is not supported (please contact me via github for feature requests)
